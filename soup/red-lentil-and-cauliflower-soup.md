Instructions
------------

1. In a 4-quart soup pot over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering.
2. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but not brown. (5m)
3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until aromatic. (30s)
4. Stir in the cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper until aromatic. (30s)
5. Stir in the tomato paste to incorporate, followed by the lentils.
6. Add the broth and salt, and bring to a boil.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
8. If the lentils have absorbed most of the broth, add more as needed, starting with 1 cup, for a thick but soupy consistency.
9. Add the cauliflower and return the mixture to a boil.
10. Reduce the heat so the soup is at a simmer and cook until the cauliflower is soft. (20m)
11. Remove from the heat and puree until smooth using an immersion blender.
12. Stir in the coconut milk and lemon juice, then taste, and season with additional salt, if desired.
13. Ladle the soup among the bowls, garnish with a drizzle of coconut milk, if desired, and serve hot.

Storage: Refrigerate for up to 4 days. Gently reheat over low heat, stirring regularly. The soup may thicken as it sits, so you may want to add a splash of broth or water to loosen it up.
