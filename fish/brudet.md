Instructions

1. Warm the oil in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the garlic and sauté until aromatic, about 30 seconds.
3. Add the onion slices and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the chopped tomatoes and sauté until they are softened and cooked down, about 10 minutes.
5. Stir in the tomato paste, white wine, parsley, thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer.
6. Add the fish and pasta and enough stock to cover the fish, about 2 cups. Return to a simmer for 1 minute.
   If there is not enough liquid to cover the fish, add water.
7. Allow the fish to cook for 10 minutes giving the saucepan the occasional shake.
   Do not stir or you will break the fish.
8. Check the seasoning. Add salt and pepper if required.
9. Add the mussels and shrimp. Continue to simmer until the fish is cooked through, the mussels have opened, and the pasta is al dente.
