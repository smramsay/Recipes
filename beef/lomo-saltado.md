9. Add red onion, bell pepper, habanero, and scallion with a large pinch of salt.
10. Cook until onions and pepper just begin to soften.

### Alternative Browning Method

4. Let juices reduce until almost entirely gone.
5. Re-add meat and stir to coat the meat with the reduction and finish browning.
