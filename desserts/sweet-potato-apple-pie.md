**Prep 3 to 8 hours before**

1. In a gallon Ziplock bag, combine filling's sugar, salt, cinnamon, five-spice, and white pepper.
2. Peel, quarter, and slice apples lengthwise into 1/2-inch wedges.
3. Add apple slices to the bag and shake until well coated.
4. Set aside, flipping occasionally, until slices have lost 1/3 of their volume. (3h)

**Crumble**

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, cinnamon, and five-spice.
2. In a blender, pulse almonds until roughly chopped and add to flour bowl.
3. Add the sugars and thyme to the blender and blend until thyme is evenly incorporated into the sugar.
4. Add blender contents to flour bowl and whisk everything together.
5. Pour melted butter over flour mixture and thoroughly mix until no dry flour remains.

**Filling**

1. Peel and quarter sweet potatoes length-wise.
2. Cut each quarter crosswise to get 1/2-inch-thick wedges.
3. Add potato to 3 quart sauce pan and cover with cold water.
4. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a low simmer.
5. Cook until easily pierced by a knife, but not completely cooked through. (5m)
6. Drain and run under cool water to halt cooking and set aside to cool to room temperature. (15m)
9. Add potatoes and tapioca starch to finished apple bag and toss to combine.

**Assembly and Baking**
