1. Heat oil in a large skillet.
2. Lay mushrooms in a single layer in the pan, stirring frequently to evaporate released water.
3. Cook until mushrooms are tender and brown. (5m)
   If using any garlic or butter, add to pan a few minutes before finishing.
4. If using cream, add after mushrooms have browned and stir until reduced to a clingy sauce.
5. Add any fresh delicate herbs after removing from heat and stir to help them wilt.
