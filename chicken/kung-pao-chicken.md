Instructions
------------

1. Place the chicken in a medium bowl, cover with cold water, and vigorously agitate it. Drain through a fine-mesh strainer set in the sink and press on the chicken with your hands to remove excess water.
2. Combine the soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, wine, and sesame oil in a small bowl and stir together until homogenous. Set aside.
3. Combine the cornstarch and water in a separate small bowl and stir with a fork until the cornstarch is dissolved.
4. Marinate the chicken for at least 15 minutes.
5. Before you stir-fry, get your bowls ready:
   a. Marinated chicken
   b. Cornstarch slurry
   c. Ginger, garlic, and dry chiles
   d. Zucchini and bell peppers
   e. Scallions and peanuts
   f. Sauce
6. Using a paper towel, rub a thin film of oil into a wok and set it over high heat until smoking. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat.
7. Immediately add the chicken and cook without moving until lightly browned. (1m)
8. Continue cooking, tossing and stirring frequently, until the exterior is opaque but the chicken is still slightly raw in the center. (2m)
9. Wipe out the wok and reheat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and swirl to coat.
10. Immediately add the ginger, garlic, and chiles and stir-fry until the chiles darken in color. (10s)
11. Immediately add the zucchini and peppers and stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. (1m)
12. Add the scallions and peanuts and toss to combine.
13. Return the chicken to the wok and toss everything to combine.
14. Stir the sauce and add to the wok by pouring it around the edges.
15. Stir the cornstarch slurry and add a splash, tossing, until the sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked through. (30s)
16. Adjust the sauce consistency with more cornstarch slurry if it is too thin or a splash of water if it is too thick. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with steamed rice.
